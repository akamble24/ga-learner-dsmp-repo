### Project Overview

 The Human Activity Recognition database was built from the recordings of 30 study participants performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors. The objective is to classify activities into one of the six activities performed.


### Learnings from the project

 To explore data insights in depth, 
To implement Support Vector Machines, 
To perform feature selection with the help of Support Vector Machines, 
To find best suitable hyperparameters with the help of grid search providing better understanding of the usage of hyperparmeter tuning.
