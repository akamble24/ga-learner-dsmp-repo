### Project Overview

 Your friend from Iowa, whose housing problem you solved, is now moving to Melbourne for a new assignment Down Under. As you have solved his Iowa housing problem so well, he wants you to solve his Melbourne housing problem too. Armed with your new found expertise in regularization, let's work on the Melbourne housing data using regularized regression. Each observation is a different house attribute with various features, like the number of properties that exist in the suburb, land size, building size, governing council for the area, real estate agent,price of the house, etc.


### Learnings from the project

 Following concepts were applied in this project:

Train-test split, Correlation between the features, Linear Regression, Polynomial Regressor, Lasso Regressor, Ridge Regressor, R^2 Evaluation Metrics
